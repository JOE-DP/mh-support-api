# Mental Health API
This is an example of an API which allows a user to search the database for mental health support services, based upon queries such as mental health condition or the name of the support organisation. The database is generically populated as the page is an example of a potential API rather than a functional service, therefore I would not wish those who needed support to use ths service.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node.js.


## Optimizations

If I had more time I would add additional query parameters such as location of service or the ability to search by address. I would like to create a functional API which offers the service however, I would not be able to offer the attention it would require to maintain and update the API. Additionally I would further optomise by using an exterbal database such as Mongo DB in order to allow for greater data organisation through an ODM such as Mongoose. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that by using JavaScript and Node.js is was possible to make a functional API withoyut requiring an external database, though I do understand why an external database would provide additional benefits.
