    <p>This API has been designed to allow web developers to implement features which will return information which is related to mental health, and the support which is in place in the UK.</p>
    <br>
    <p><span>Disclaimer:</span> this API has been developed as part of a learning experience and it is not monitored or updated, therefore I do not take any responsibility for any negative outcomes of using the services, and if someone needs mental health support, it is always best to seek professional medical support. I also have no connection to any of the organisations used in this API</p>
